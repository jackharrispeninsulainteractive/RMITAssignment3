                    <u><strong><p>What Changes are we going to implement for A3 & A5?</p></strong></u>
                    <p>From examining these lists, we will look at changing how we use nonverbal communication and really make a focused effort to work together as a group! We are incredible with video chats, but we fall short with written messaging on MS Teams our biggest change will be a focused push to improve all verbal communication between the group. We will also really be focused on submitting the content as we complete it in draft form, this will allow us to have a greater review process and drastically improve the quality of the work produced by each group members. Finally, the last key point is on time management, introducing the drafting requirements will help elevate this as the main issue revolved around receiving the documents at the 11th hour for compilation to the main assignment, having the early draft review resolves that group issue as everything must be submitted early.</p>

                    <h5><u><strong>Career Plans</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Looking at each of our career plans we can see a number is differences in the process of the individual and their concepts about how to achieve the outcome, we can see Jacks career plan focuses mainly on his ability to create and market a SaaS product to serve a s reference, whilst Noahs focuses mainly on skill gaining and learning via tools such as Skill Share, Udemy & Universities like RMIT, this idea is reflected in Alexâ€™s plan to conduct conclude is degree with RMIT before taking steps to advance his career, Alex also has a focused on university degree and learning before taking steps into the industry. Finally, Jaydyn follows a similar form to Noah and Alex with a career plan that focuses on obtaining skills via university and then approaching employers after that point in time. </p>
                    <p>We can see looking at these plans that Jack stands out with the different plan of using university to build skills whilst producing a product to serve as a demonstration of those skills in action. It is a plan that focuses on developing a real-world implementation and demonstration of the skill set before focusing on employers and could be a fantastic strategy for obtaining the goal career.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>"I really feel that my initial career plan was a fantastic choice for me, I learn more from practice than a course so to develop a real world application that holds value to show employers is really the best move for me, I think this approach will also really carry some weight as even if the application or app is unsuccessful from a financing perspective it demonstrates to an employers some that Iâ€™m extremely drive, self-motivated and extremely capable at full stack development and web programming."</p>

                        <li>Develop a business plan for a SaaS product with a defined achievable goal (Minimal Viable Product), this could be anything from Status Page to a maintenance Manager suite, the key is to create a product companies would need but also have it be achieved for a project for 1-2 years development.</li>
                        <li>Whilst continuing my study with RMIT I will begin to develop this SaaS product with the aim of developing a small sellable product using the industry standards such as PHP and its MVC framework larval.</li>
                        <li>Market this product as a sole trader with business name. once the SaaS product is in sellable position start to do some basic marketing including setting up as a sole trader and business name with website to sell the product.</li>
                        <li>Use this experience and current product on the market as a demonstration of your skills, this project would server as your reference and experience and would be able to be demonstrated to the potential employer. This product does not have to be a success or earn money as its purpose is to demonstrate your worth and capabilities, however it is important that it appears to be successful, proper, and professional. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>With this strategy you can have a physical and real display of your capabilities as a developer, it would also serve as an excellent education tool for you to learn the frame works and skills during the development time. This allows you to not only gain the skills required for the job but allows you to have a golden display and marketing for your skill set, whilst it may seem like a longer strategy in the short term, this will have a substantial benefit over a great period. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>"I still plan on learning more about HTML and other coding languages, still a long road ahead of me but with all the services and help on the internet I will one day be good or even great at it. For me to learn more I will need to set aside more time to do so and learn that it is not the end of the world if I do make a mistake. Coding is a lot of trial and error in the beginning so I shouldn't be afraid to try new things and work harder on them. I will make sure to follow the tutorials needed and learn what is possible at my level to progress. I still very much believe skillshare and Udemy are great course based learning sites that I do plan to use in the future. W3Schools has definitely been the most useful so far too as I have used it a dozen times or more."</p>

                      <p>How I expect to be able to learn the skills required that I have no knowledge of is both through RMIT and outside sources, I will make do the best with the time I have and put my brain and time to learning these skills required. I may use websites such as W3Schools, I may use Skill Share or Udemy. On these websites there are plenty of tutorials and courses from basic to advanced. I will chip away at these till I am confident enough in my ability to be able to produce full-fledged websites with little to no help from google. I will make sure to train my brain to look for mistakes and ways I can be more efficient with my code. I will not be afraid to ask for help from my superiors so I can understand things I currently do not.</p>

This experience has reinforced my initial job plan giving me a solid idea of the path that I need to follow. I still intend to get a Masters in IT after a Bachelor in IT. Meanwhile relevant employment would give me the work experience necessary to get a post graduate job in a well-known company preparing me for an eventual lead role and Software Engineer position."</p>

I do plan on changing my career plan to working within the UI design space, with a review of my Career path I believe I can achieve much more by opening my study and education path by showing interest in other IT careers in the front-end development space.

                        <p>The area of IT I have been interested in is Cybersecurity which is a field of IT specializing in the protection of network and computer systems. The field is becoming increasingly significant due to the increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p>
                        <p>I am currently studying at RMIT University and planning on going into a Bachelor of Information Technology course after studying and finishing 2 introduction courses in Programming and Information Technology. Through studying this course I hope to develop my skills in various Programming languages and skills within working with computer and network systems. With my understanding of the current IT industry climate, I believe that acquiring this job without hardship as the industry seems to be actively growing and is a necessary part of the current IT industry as a whole.</p>
