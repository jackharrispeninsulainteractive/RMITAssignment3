                    <h5><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Stirling is going to be a revolutionary social media platform aimed at the video game community, Stirling will be an app on mobile devices and a website on computers (all mock-up images are displayed as the app form). There are several key features of this new platform, the first and foremost of which is the integration with other platforms, Stirling will link in the ever-growing amount of gaming sales platforms and serve as a single point of communication to grab users’ notifications from applications such a twitch, steam and battle.net. </p>
                    <p>we have identified the increasing amount of competition within the gaming platform market as a negative that the community is unhappy with and will be developing Stirling to help assist and ease that problem as a result, we also acknowledge there would be a substantial demand for the a integrated hub application to link in all the third party gaming platforms for organisation, management and ease of use.</p>
                    <p>Stirling will also have several key features internally such as an integrated calendar and messaging system that will allow users to invite and organise each other’s game sessions and increase the social aspects of gaming. To accompany this feature, we will be providing a looking to play section with in the find friends page that will allow users to find people who are interested in playing similar games to them with in their geographical area. This section is one of our core flag ship features and we believe would really for fill a social demand. This feature will allow users to browse certain games and find and connect with users who are also looking for people to socially play with and accompany them on their gaming journey.</p>
                    <p>Due to the impacts of Covid-19 on all our lives we understand that now more than ever that the mental health of people in our community must become a priority for all of us to focus on. That’s why Stirling will be designed form day one to be all about connecting and rebuilding everyone’s social circles and life through the Covid-19 Safe hobby of gaming.</p>
                    <p>Gaming for a lot of people has always been a part of their lives and I think for all of us some of the best memories have been when we have come together with friends at a Lan Party or online, for all of us it’s really always been a adventure for us to connect and spent time together, we believe that Stirling is the application to be developed to help us get back to those roots and spirit. With the gaming community become more fractured with more plat forms such as Steam, Battle.net, Epic Store a application such as our proposed one to come in and relink them all together under one banner is breath of fresh air!</p>

                    <h5><u><strong>Motivation</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a team we sat down in one of our first meetings to discuss what project to pursue for this assignment, we had some fantastic suggestions from Jack’s maintenance manager to Noah’s art collection application and whilst we were very tempted by some of the fantastic options by the group, we ultimately settled on Jaydyns social gaming application as we felt and strongly believe that this type of a application will provide such a benefit to the wider community in these trouble times. </p>
                    <p>This social reconnection platform has the potential to provide meaning full change and whilst the other idea would be fantastic applications this was the one that jumped out to us as having the widest and best impact for people’s health and wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>Our proposed application and its associated features as briefly discussed in the project idea overview section really have a change to impact and give something back, that’s why we have chosen it as our project and why we are all so passionate about pursuing this application to its fulfilment and success. </p>
                    <p>As previous gamers and current gamers we really resonate with the community and its needs, this has allowed to us use that in touch perspective to build this idea out to a concept that really functions and beliefs all its users to socially connect and regain that social aspects of life that covid has reduced.</p>
                    <div class="Spacer"></div>
                    <h5><strong><u>LandScape</u></strong></h5>
                    <br>
                 <p>We are aiming to jump into the gaming landscape for the computer market, there are several marketplace and communication platforms that we will be in direct competition with, these include Steam, Discord, and the epic store. Whilst these platforms have an extremely largely market share and extremely solid branding, we will be focusing on bridging the gap and working to implement a system that bridges the partisan. To do this we will create a integration system that will let you invite users to games in other platforms, as our platform starts to grow and gain users we will approach companies, game developers and platforms to start to create these integrations. With this business model we want to work with the current platforms rather than become a direct competitor to them.</p>
