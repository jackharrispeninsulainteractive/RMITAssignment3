                    <h5><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Stirling is going to be a revolutionary social media platform aimed at the video game community, Stirling will be an app on mobile devices and a website on computers (all mock-up images are displayed as the app form). There are several key features of this new platform, the first and foremost of which is the integration with other platforms, Stirling will link in the ever-growing amount of gaming sales platforms and serve as a single point of communication to grab users’ notifications from applications such a twitch, steam and battle.net. </p>
                    <p>we have identified the increasing amount of competition within the gaming platform market as a negative that the community is unhappy with and will be developing Stirling to help assist and ease that problem as a result, we also acknowledge there would be a substantial demand for the a integrated hub application to link in all the third party gaming platforms for organisation, management and ease of use.</p>
                    <p>Stirling will also have several key features internally such as an integrated calendar and messaging system that will allow users to invite and organise each other’s game sessions and increase the social aspects of gaming. To accompany this feature, we will be providing a looking to play section with in the find friends page that will allow users to find people who are interested in playing similar games to them with in their geographical area. This section is one of our core flag ship features and we believe would really for fill a social demand. This feature will allow users to browse certain games and find and connect with users who are also looking for people to socially play with and accompany them on their gaming journey.</p>
                    <p>Due to the impacts of Covid-19 on all our lives we understand that now more than ever that the mental health of people in our community must become a priority for all of us to focus on. That’s why Stirling will be designed form day one to be all about connecting and rebuilding everyone’s social circles and life through the Covid-19 Safe hobby of gaming.</p>
                    <p>Gaming for a lot of people has always been a part of their lives and I think for all of us some of the best memories have been when we have come together with friends at a Lan Party or online, for all of us it’s really always been a adventure for us to connect and spent time together, we believe that Stirling is the application to be developed to help us get back to those roots and spirit. With the gaming community become more fractured with more plat forms such as Steam, Battle.net, Epic Store a application such as our proposed one to come in and relink them all together under one banner is breath of fresh air!</p>

                    <h5><u><strong>Motivation</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a team we sat down in one of our first meetings to discuss what project to pursue for this assignment, we had some fantastic suggestions from Jack’s maintenance manager to Noah’s art collection application and whilst we were very tempted by some of the fantastic options by the group, we ultimately settled on Jaydyns social gaming application as we felt and strongly believe that this type of a application will provide such a benefit to the wider community in these trouble times. </p>
                    <p>This social reconnection platform has the potential to provide meaning full change and whilst the other idea would be fantastic applications this was the one that jumped out to us as having the widest and best impact for people’s health and wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>Our proposed application and its associated features as briefly discussed in the project idea overview section really have a change to impact and give something back, that’s why we have chosen it as our project and why we are all so passionate about pursuing this application to its fulfilment and success. </p>
                    <p>As previous gamers and current gamers we really resonate with the community and its needs, this has allowed to us use that in touch perspective to build this idea out to a concept that really functions and beliefs all its users to socially connect and regain that social aspects of life that covid has reduced.</p>

                            <p>Home Page
                                Stirling’s home page comprehends all the notifications that the user may receive. These can be from Steam, Epic Games, Twitch or any other service registered, allowing the gamer to keep updated from all his/her favourite services in one app. This is the default page when the app opens, but once you have moved to another section this will be reachable again through the home icon that is located in the bottom middle of the screen. Here the player will visual all his/her and his/her friend’s trophies, friendship requests and game invites from friends. It is possible to receive notifications from the community of all the games selected and also information about any new seasons, new updates or any useful information provided by the developers. You can also receive notifications when your favourite streamers start their live shows from the various platforms. If the user does not want to receive information about every friend, it is possible to create a strict group of people to appear on home page by going in the setting’s menu (top right icon on the screen). All the notifications present on the home page have the day and time they were sent on the top left corner of the message, allowing the user to understand how old a notification is.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center"><strong><u>Searching for new players</u></strong></p>
                            <p>To reach Stirling’s search section the player will need to click the magnifying glass icon which is located in the bottom left of the application. This section is then divided into two functions. On the top you can search for friends by name, or use filters like selecting a specific game and platforms so that all the people compatible with your settings appear on the screen. In facts it is possible to see all the video games and various platforms the user uses. Below this function there is a section with recommended games. Here, based on what game, what genre and for how long the user played to certain titles, similar video games with their icons will appear. The recommendation will also be influenced by how popular the video games are in that period, counting people playing but also people spectating in live stream. If the user is interested in one of these games, by simply clicking on its icon he will visualise the video game community, allowing him to find someone to play with, useful information about new updates, new seasons and players that stream this game.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center"><strong><u>Friends Screen</u></strong></p>
                             <p>The friends screen on Stirling will take a lot of inspiration for applications like Discord and Slack and feature all the friends down the left-hand side of the screen with icon only, this keeps it uncluttered and clean, on discord or slack this section would be the servers or groups how ever here we are using that great design for the users’ friends. To switch between friends all the users must do is click on the icon of the left and the screen will reactively change to that friend. Following in the similar vein and design philosophy as the rest of the components the friend’s system will be really about keeping it simple and clean and having a core focus on putting users and their communication first, the friends screen purposely omits any form of profile like Facebook and Instagram have and instead focus solely on putting users in control of their communication.</p>
                             <p>The friend’s section will also interface with third party apps to provide you game invites and notifications directly to this screen with out having to exit the app. This is represented in our moch artwork by the CS go invite screen. Lastly each player will display the game they are currently playing at the top of the screen. Here in our example, we can see that Xela is in game counter strike global offensive. This gives you active feedback about what your friends are playing and allows you to jump into a game with them.</p>

                    <h5><strong><u>Description</u> | App Integration with other programs</strong></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of the core features of this app will be integration with other gaming programs, whilst at the start we understand that integration might not be possible with larger companies, it will be a continuing drive and push of hours to realize this program. Stirling will sit as a man in the middle and allow users to grab game data from any number of sources on their computers, these can include Battle.net, Steam, Epic Games and the GeForce Experience, the current fractured climate with game launchers is something that the community is not happy with and developing this tool we will be fulling the needs of the community. This need and unacceptable with the current level of integration is what we believe will allow Stirling to grow and gather speed with integrations.</p>
                    <p>In App integration allows users to span different communities and each out to people that they may not have ever spoken too before or had an opportunity to interactive with before. As stated in our motivation section this app is all about getting people back together and social after Covid19 and the significant metal health impact that it has had on all members of our life & community.</p>
                    <div class="SpacerSmall"></div>
                    <h5><strong><u>Description</u> | Funding & Fiancees</strong></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>To start off we will fund the development of Stirling by ourselves, in order to do this each of us will work 3 days a week at a stable job allowing us the following 2 days each to develop the app, once we reach a stage in the development that we can deploy a alpha build we will deploy to a vulture VPS, this allow us to reduce costs by keeping the VM small at the start and then increase it in size as our user base and the required load increases. Vulture have fantastic VPS coverage in Sydney and around the world and would be a fantastic providers for this application. </p>
                    <p><em>** An Important note to remember is that whilst we wont be paid for the initial start up time the 3 days paid will be designed to offset our bills and allow us the starting development time needed to attract a bigger backer **</em></p>
                    <p>As we start to increase in size we will start to pitch the concept to bigger organization and backers in an attempt to get more funding ideally we would want to have between 250,000 – 500,000 users at this stage. Once we can demonstrate the demand for the product and its value we will attempt to get a partner involved to fiancé the reset of its development.</p>
                    <div class="Spacer"></div>
                    <h5><u><strong>Tools & Tech</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>The tools needed for this project include but are not limited to Trello, PHP Storm, Microsoft Teams, Discord, GitHub, GitHub for VS and Vultr. Trello is used to organize the entirety of the project. It can be put into 3 sections, Planned, In Progress and Completed. When in planned its items, you will work on but have not been commenced yet. You can assign a member of the team to a specific role so other teammates are aware of what they are working on. In Progress shows the work that in currently being done. Completed shows what has been finalized and finished. PHP Storm will be used to program the app, having many codes imbedded meaning you can work on both the front end in Java Script and PHP for the backend functions. Microsoft teams will be the program of choice for meetings and organizing when meetings will happen. With the recording function on MS Teams users can look back at meetings. Discord can be used as the primary messaging service of choice as it is very versatile and available on every platform. GitHub is used to back up and keep code in their repositories. Best place to store it and test it on the fly. GitHub for VS is used so we can send code to GitHub in a way that does not disrupt the workflow. Vultr will be our virtual sever hosing of choice. It has many server choices for beginners, ranging from $6 to $256 a month. The best choice for us would be the $48 plan as we can always scale up the plan when the user base is growing. Vultr has a large range of data center worldwide and is high speed networking for public and private servers. Vultr has a very user friendly control panel which is especially valuable when expanding and managing your infrastructure.</p>

                    <h5><u><strong>Key Skills</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>The skills needed for this project include Java Script, using an IDE, PHP. Teamwork and multitasking. PHP will be necessary for programming the back-end functionalities and designs. Java Script is needed to be learnt so that we can have an interactive front end that is completely functional. The use of an IDE is necessary so the user will have to be comfortable in their knowledge of how to navigate and use the IDE for programming functions. Teamwork is a large part of these projects therefore you will need to understand how to show good teamwork and working in a group without problems. Each member will be working with each other, so a safe environment has to be made. Multitasking will be needed when doing this project as each member will have a lot on their plate</p>
