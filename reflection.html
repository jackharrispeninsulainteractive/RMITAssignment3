                    <h5><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                  <p>Examining the core elements of the reviews from our team we can see a number of trends; these mainly focus on the improvements on the teamwork. Everyone has really highlighted this as a key area that the team has performed extremely well in. Looking at individual elements and members of the group we can see that Jaydyn has really stepped up this assignment and increase his interactivity with team by showing initiative and a want and drive to get into teaming and work together the project. Noah has really come into his element whilst working on our logos, design and branding, we can see that this is really a passion of his and its so fantastic to see that be applied to the group and project. Alex has really stepped up into  the group work and been present and active at way more meeting than A2! He has also done fantastic work on our project aims & group communication sections. Finally Jack has done a great job loading the PHP development of our app, its so fantastic and exciting to see how much progress has been made in such short time!
                      To summarize as a group we have worked even better than A2 and if we would continue working together we would only be expecting even better and greater things!

                    <p>With Assignment 3 I believe that we worked even better then with Assignment 2, as we have worked together for a longer period of time we have learnt each other’s strengths and weaknesses, meaning each member was aligned to a role that fit their personality and work ethic. The thing that I believe went the best was Jack’s PHP development in line with the Back-end. The thing that surprised me the most was using Affinity Design for the first time and getting the hang of it immediately, I then from my first time using it went on to create the “Crew Us” logo. I believe that once again communication could be better at some points. I enjoyed learning about my teammates and believe that no other team would have been as suited to me. Jack was a powerhouse in this Assignment and tackled the Back-end with ease and he did incredibly. Alex did a great job at Aims, and Scopes and limits. As well as Jaydyn who Tools and Technologies really well, A++ job boys. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Working in group for this assignment has been a great experience. The organisation has improved a lot since last assignment, being probably our best skill. This has permitted the whole group to move well through potential obstacles and finish the work in the best way possible. A consequence of this key has been the great time management that brought as to finish all the tasks in time. Also Communication skills have improved since Assignment 2, but it is probably still an aspect that can improve a lot. This would help the members to keep update on the status of the tasks of the rest of the group and possibly help them if needed. Since it offers only benefits to the group it is surely something we should work on. One thing that I felt was surprising was the importance of the weekly meeting. At the beginning it didn’t realty notice the huge potential they offered  the whole group, allowing us all to coordinate and work well in team.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I think building on our experience in the creation of A2, we have really jumped well into this assignment well. I think that building off what we learned in our communication skills really helped in this assignment. I am surprised that whilst communication is decent it has lapsed slightly whilst moving into A3, I think this is due to everyone being a lot more comfortable with the group, I would highlight this as an issues and like to really focus in on communication still. Jaydyn really stepped up his group communication. It was good to have him more involved this assignment. </p>
                    <p>Due to A3 feeling like a continuation of A1 & A2 I personality started to feel a lot of drag and lack of interest on setting. I think this is due to the assessment feeling like one big continuation rather than new and exciting tasks. </p>
                    <p>Overall, I’m really happy with the team. I think we have continued to work together well and whilst communication could be improved overall we are in a good spot. Noah, Alex & Jaydyn all really stepped us this assessment and were way more proactive and involved</p>

                    <p>Throughout this assignment, I found it amazing the teamwork that was present within the group, the members within our team were great to work with, with everyone having different strengths and skills we were able to allocate work based on these factors for example some of us within the group had more knowledge within the coding and development aspect of the assignment, so we decided to allocate those towards those roles and used this method for other skills and allocated jobs for those other skills.  I also still stand to improve my on-time management skills as this caused some issues towards the start of this assignment but through working with my group and talking about what needed to be done I was able to catch up and support my group with some of the tasks that needed to be completed. I found it surprising with it came to working with some of the Design parts of the assignment as a tool that some of the members have previously used I needed to use to make a simple graph but found out that I enjoy using that tool and have equipped that into my tools for my other assignments and projects.</p>
