                    <p>I think our group for assignment 2 has been fantastic, overall, we have functioned well together as a team. At the start of this assignment, I proposed we use an additional tool called trello. I think this was a game changer and has really allowed us to manage our time so much more efficiently. Noah & Alex have really stepped up to the plate this assignment and have both been very active on MS Teams and trello with regular updates and communications on their assigned tasks. Noah did a fantastic job on the first coding of the site and creating the template for the report. He has defiantly seen a big increase in his work value since A1. Jaydyn was great with the interview and project, I worked extremely closely with him on those topics, and he had some awesome input.</p>
                    <p>Moving forward I would really like it if we could get more into their habit of ticking off individual components being completed on trello as opposed to waiting till a whole section is done. For example, this could be that during the project write up we have 5 sections, overview, motivation, description, skills and tools it would be fantastic for the team to update them as we go, for example if Alex competes the motivation part if thatâ€™s marked off during the development phase and uploaded it will all keep us in the loop with what is required and what is still pending. I was surprised how well we functioned as a group as we only had minimal interactions before the start of the assessment.</p>

                    <p>As we formed the group for this assignment it was pretty daunting as I haven't done that many group assignments throughout my studies but as we got into doing the meetings I found that we seem to work well together, With Jack being a really good group leader laying at each of the tasks into short step but step easy to follow objectives this allowed us to relax as we had a clear goal for each of the modules allocated to each of us. </p>
                    <p>I think on a personal note of what could be improved could be the communication skills, being my first real-time working in a group environment I struggled to find the balance of communicating where I am at and if I needed assistance in a given task. One thing that surprised me is how having a group to work with can be much less stressful as there are people I can easily call on for help on a given task and many of the hiccups were able be remedied with the help of the group, one of the skills I can take away from doing this assignment is my ability to work in a group and discuss different topics and ideas within the group.</p>
