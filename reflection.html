                    <h5><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>All the group members have submitted some great feedback for this group assessment, this overview will summaries our feedback as one team. Overall, all the group members have reported that we have functioned extremely well. Some great key feedback has been that Trello has been extremely well received for project management, Jack has used the software before, but it was new to Jaydyn, Alex and Noah, both Alex and Noah have commented on how effective it was at keeping us on track and monitoring exactly what tasks are in progress and what tasks are completed. On the counter to this the universal feedback was that MS Teams did not suit the teamwork flow, all the team members made every effort to use it and will continue to for A3 & A5 but the reflection has been that it is a worse method of communication than Discord & Slack. </p>
                    <p><em>(NOTE: This is a personal preference for our groups workflow, MS Teams may suit a different group, we also understand this is a requirement and not debatable and will ensure its used for the duration of the assessments.)</em></p>
                    <p>Alex and Jack have provided some great feedback about time management and communication, Alex has suggested we focus quicker on the assignment and jump start into it sooner, Jack and suggested we focus on real time updates of where we are all at on Trello, these two suggestions will be incorporated into the group for A3 & A5 and really build upon the current fantastic team cohesion that we currently have.</p>
                    <p>Noah and Alex and complimented Jack’s ability to step in as project lead for the team, looking back at our personality tests this aligns correctly with what was stated in the personality profile and team analysis conducted during this assignment. Expanding on that Jack has provided great feedback for Noah, Alex and Jaydyn, complimenting them on their dedicated, creativity and input to the team, this sentiment was reflected across all the team members reviews.</p>
                    <p>To summaries our reflections indicate the success of the team to function cohesively, each group member has contributed and reflected their positive thoughts about the other group members during each of the reflections. We have identified some great areas for improvement and are all exited to jump into A3 & A5!</p>

                    <p>In Assignment 2 I believe that each of my teammates did really well. Jack was good with taking the role of leader and motivating us to get our tasks done on time. Alex was good at getting his tasks done and gave some good input out. Jaydyn was very creative and came up with some very interesting ideas, especially regarding the project. While time management was in place well, I do believe we had space to improve it and next time we could keep our times better. I was pleasantly surprised with how well we all worked together as a team, going into it I was a bit worried but after our first meeting I knew we had this. I am glad I picked to team up with Jaydyn, Alex and Jack as I believe they’re the best team I could have chosen. What I believe was the worst part of this project was having to use Microsoft Teams, as I feel the platform is cluttered and not very user friendly. If I had a choice, it would not be used in further projects. Another thing we got to using was Trello which helped a lot with organization, and I thank Jack a lot for introducing us to it. Overall while not perfect, I believe we all work well together and look forwards to whatever we are up to next.</p>

                    <p>The project is almost finished and it seems it will conclude in a positive way. During this period Jack assumed a Leadership position and did an excellent job of organizing and dividing the material throughout all the members of the group. We all did our best on every task and were keen to help the others when possible, which I have learnt is probably one of the most important things in group work. Throughout this task I discovered that Trello is very useful. We used this website to divide all the points of the assessment, keeping the members updated on our individual jobs and sharing material. This was the first time I had used this website and seeing how useful it was, has been a good discovery. For the next assessment I think that we should work more on our time management because this could be an area that can be improved. We have all been working a lot in these last two weeks when we could have started working on some aspects earlier. Overall, we have done well and I am very happy about the results I have seen.</p>

                    <p>I think our group for assignment 2 has been fantastic, overall, we have functioned well together as a team. At the start of this assignment, I proposed we use an additional tool called trello. I think this was a game changer and has really allowed us to manage our time so much more efficiently. Noah & Alex have really stepped up to the plate this assignment and have both been very active on MS Teams and trello with regular updates and communications on their assigned tasks. Noah did a fantastic job on the first coding of the site and creating the template for the report. He has defiantly seen a big increase in his work value since A1. Jaydyn was great with the interview and project, I worked extremely closely with him on those topics, and he had some awesome input.</p>
                    <p>Moving forward I would really like it if we could get more into their habit of ticking off individual components being completed on trello as opposed to waiting till a whole section is done. For example, this could be that during the project write up we have 5 sections, overview, motivation, description, skills and tools it would be fantastic for the team to update them as we go, for example if Alex competes the motivation part if that’s marked off during the development phase and uploaded it will all keep us in the loop with what is required and what is still pending. I was surprised how well we functioned as a group as we only had minimal interactions before the start of the assessment.</p>

                    <p>As we formed the group for this assignment it was pretty daunting as I haven't done that many group assignments throughout my studies but as we got into doing the meetings I found that we seem to work well together, With Jack being a really good group leader laying at each of the tasks into short step but step easy to follow objectives this allowed us to relax as we had a clear goal for each of the modules allocated to each of us. </p>
                    <p>I think on a personal note of what could be improved could be the communication skills, being my first real-time working in a group environment I struggled to find the balance of communicating where I am at and if I needed assistance in a given task. One thing that surprised me is how having a group to work with can be much less stressful as there are people I can easily call on for help on a given task and many of the hiccups were able be remedied with the help of the group, one of the skills I can take away from doing this assignment is my ability to work in a group and discuss different topics and ideas within the group.</p>
