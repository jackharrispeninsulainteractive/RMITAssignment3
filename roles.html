                    <h5><u><strong>Roles Overview</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>These roles are not final as the tasks tend to change as different systems come into play. But overall, this is the most comprehensive decision of each members final role. Each member had a specific category of role they were to fill but it was not stuck to each day. Each member would have other tasks set therefore they would be made to do work outside of their specific niche. If we’re speaking on a case-to-case bases Jack’s role didn’t change as much as the others as he had a more abundant role, that being said Noah’s role didn’t change much either, unlike Jaydyn and Alex who were doing what was assigned to them that week. Everyone did have a role set to them but that was not a certainty that each member would do a specific task set only to that role. Each member did a good job however doing what was set for them in their roles</p>
                    <br>
                    <h5><u><strong>Why Are Roles Important?</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>The benefits of each of us having roles are that we can clearly seperate programming and business. When it comes to programming you need a clear line of communication and you need a great understanding which will be more hindered if we decided that another member would just do it instead. As some members started with programming from the start they have a comprehensive understanding of what is supposed to happen and what will continue to happen. When it comes to business decisions well that being seperated is a good idea too for the same reasons but also because the business sides of things can get heavy and need your full investment we don't have time for mucking around and people not understanding what the task they're assigned is</p>
                    <br>
                    <h5><u><strong>Roles Breakdown</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Noah: Lead Front-End Developer</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In this role Noah will oversee the Front-End development surrounding Crewus. In this task he will be implementing the HTML, CSS and JS components needed for a complete website and app design. Noah will take initiative over Front-End choices and decisions. The skills required for this role are programming, problem solving and leadership. Programming skills are needed as he will be coding the front-end designs and the problem solving will come in handy when problems inevitably occur, and Noah needs to fix them. Leadership is also a key skill as he will need to lead the choices when it comes to front end design and he will be responsible for the overarching choices.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Jack: Lead Back-End Developer</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In this role Jack will be responsible for most if not all the back-end design when it comes to the Crewus app and website. The backend developer role involves a lot of programming beyond what is a beginner understanding. Jack will be tasked with making a sign in system that comprehensively works in our app and website. He will be using PHP Storm primarily as his IDE of choice and in which he uses HTML, CSS, blank and blank. The skills Jack will need for back-end development include coding, leadership position and time management. Coding skill is required as he will be doing a lot of that and therefore needs to understand what he is doing. Time management is required as he will have a set schedule he and the other members will need to follow. Leadership is required as he will oversee the back end and will need to be proper and punctual with his abilities. He will lead other members in the group in terms of what to do and he is also in charge of making sure we each come to meetings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Jaydyn: Business Strategist</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Jaydyn’s role is Business Strategist, in this role he will be doing a lot of back end business. He will be think over how things will work and how he can make them work better. He will need to have good time management for this. He will need to be an outside thinker to come up with the ideas he needs. He will think up new and old strategies. His role is important as he will be assessing all the ideas and implementations and testing whether or not they'll be needed or not. He will be coming up with ideas that will benefit the group as a whole and making the project better overall. He will skillfully craft up some ideas that will be detrimental to the success of Crew Us</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Alex: Systems Implementation Officer</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This role consists of Alex helping with the ideas and implementations of those ideas.  Alex will be in charge of a lot of the back-end business side of things, so his role will have nothing to do with the coding aspects. Some skills that Alex will use include time management, brainstorming and adaptability. Alex will need to get tasks done on deadlines and that's why time management is necessary. Brainstorming is also necessary as Alex will be brainstorming ideas and functions. He will need to adapt his ideas to the developmental ideas from Noah and Jack</p>
