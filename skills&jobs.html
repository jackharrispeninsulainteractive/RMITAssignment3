                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Jack Harris</strong></p>
                    <p>Jack’s skills and strengths lie in leadership and previous knowledge due to his background in website development and programming and previous uses of Technologies and tools we used when developing our Project/Website. Jack had already shown knowledge of group management due to his background as a Lifeguard Supervisor and took a leading role within the group. With his extensive knowledge of coding and website development Jack took the job of Backend developer for the website and provided support to the rest of the group such as giving support to Noah the front end developer for the website and allocating work for the group. Jack had previously worked with tools such as phpstorm and Cms (Wordpress) and implemented these skills into the assignment using them for the development of the website.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Noah Jacobson</strong></p>
                    <p>Noah showed great use of his skills during this assignment taking on the role of creating the video for the presentation part of the assignment, due to his background in video editing, Noah also took the job of being the Front-end developer and demonstrated his skills in UX design and also stepped up to the role of designing our logo used for our business, though he used a program he is not familiar with he did have previous experience working with photoshop a similar program to what he used for the logo. He also demonstrated his skills in office suite, showing off a presentation demonstrating the development of the logo and the processes of how it changed and his decisions behind them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Alex Vorarro</strong></p>
                    <p>Alex took the role of  System implementation officer and overlooked the systems within the project and website and was in charge of assessing the aim, scope, and limitations of the project, Alex also had some hands-on experience working with various code such as Java, C++, and PHP). Alex’s role comprised of assessing what features lined up with the time constraints and assessed what needed to be done and what had to be changed for the project to be completed in time, an example of this could be not implementing a Voice and video system into our project Crew Us but focusing on the core features that are needed. Many of the skills presented by Alex has been recognized by the front end developer and the back end developer as they can communicate with Alex to come up with strategies when working with code(edited)
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Jaydyn Hoskings</strong></p>
                    <p>Jaydyn was able to demonstrate his skill in knowledge through his role of the business strategist the Crew Us project originally started from an older project idea from a previous assignment then was worked on after going into a2 and a3 and was developed with the support of his group, Jaydyn was able to present his skills when it came to features and design and many of the strategies that will be implemented within the project. Though Jaydyn did not have such an extensive background in coding and programming he was able to communicate the features towards the Back end and front end developer, some of the skills he was able to acquire was some knowledge in Ux design with the assistance of Jack and Noah was able to present his own designed graph for a testing timeline presentation, Jaydyn and Alex (System implementation officer) were able to work together to come up with a plan to tackle some of the features within the project</p>
